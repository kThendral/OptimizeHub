## LLM Integration Details

The PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md includes extensive coverage of planned LLM integration:

### Phase 1: Static Explanations (Q2 2025)
- Rule-based parameter recommendations
- Explanation templates for common scenarios
- No external API required

### Phase 2: Dynamic AI (Q3 2025)
- OpenAI/Anthropic API integration
- Natural language Q&A about results
- Personalized learning paths

### Phase 3: Fine-tuned Model (Optional)
- Specialized optimization domain model
- Offline operation for privacy
- Faster response times

### Example Use Cases Documented:
- **Students**: "Why did PSO converge faster than GA?"
- **Businesses**: "What does this save us in costs?"
- **Researchers**: "Compare algorithm performance characteristics"

## Academia & Business Use Cases

Comprehensive coverage includes:

### Academia
- **Teaching**: Visual demonstrations, no coding required
- **Research**: Rapid prototyping, baseline comparisons
- **Student Projects**: Hands-on learning, coursework solutions

### Small Businesses
