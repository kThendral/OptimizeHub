# Write a Genetic Algorithm class in Python using DEAP or pure Python
# It should inherit from the OptimizationAlgorithm base class in base.py
# The class must:
# 1. Initialize a population of candidate solutions.
# 2. Use selection, crossover, and mutation operators.
# 3. Track the best solution each generation.
# 4. Store the convergence curve (best fitness per generation).
# 5. Return results in a dictionary with algorithm name, best solution, and curve.

from .base import OptimizationAlgorithm
import random

class GeneticAlgorithm(OptimizationAlgorithm):
    def initialize(self):
        # TODO: Initialize random population based on problem variable ranges
        pass

    def optimize(self):
        # TODO: Implement main GA loop:
        # - Evaluate population fitness
        # - Select parents
        # - Apply crossover and mutation
        # - Track best solution
        # - Append best fitness to convergence curve
        pass
