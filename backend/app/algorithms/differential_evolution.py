Differential Evolution algorithm implementation.

TODO: This is a stub file for future implementation.

Differential Evolution (DE) is a population-based optimization algorithm that creates
new candidate solutions by combining existing solutions using vector differences.

Key characteristics:
- Mutation: Creates trial vectors by adding scaled differences between population members
- Crossover: Combines trial vectors with target vectors
- Selection: Greedy selection between trial and target vectors
- Particularly effective for continuous optimization problems

Implementation checklist:
1. Inherit from OptimizationAlgorithm base class
2. Implement initialize() to create initial population
3. Implement optimize() with mutation, crossover, and selection operators
4. Use problem['dimensions'], problem['bounds'], and problem['fitness_function']
5. Track best solution and convergence curve
6. Return results via get_results()

Default parameters (from config.py):
- population_size: 50
- max_iterations: 50
- F: 0.8 (differential weight)
- CR: 0.9 (crossover probability)
