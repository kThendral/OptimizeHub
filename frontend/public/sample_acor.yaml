# Sample Ant Colony Optimization (ACOR) Configuration for OptimizeHub
# This file demonstrates how to configure ACOR for continuous optimization

algorithm: ant_colony

problem:
  dimensions: 2
  fitness_function: ackley
  lower_bound: -5
  upper_bound: 5
  objective: minimize

params:
  colony_size: 30
  max_iterations: 50
  archive_size: 10
  q: 0.01
  xi: 0.85

# Parameter Guide:
# - colony_size (>= 5): Number of ants exploring per iteration
#   * 20-30: Good for most problems
#   * 50+: Better exploration for complex landscapes
#
# - archive_size (1 to colony_size): Best solutions to remember
#   * 10-20: Balanced memory (recommended)
#   * 5: Fast convergence, less diversity
#   * 30+: High diversity, slower convergence
#
# - q (> 0, typically 0.001-0.1): Controls search locality
#   * 0.01: Balanced exploration/exploitation
#   * 0.001: More exploitation (fine-tuning)
#   * 0.1: More exploration (multimodal problems)
#
# - xi (0 < xi <= 1): Speed of convergence
#   * 0.85: Balanced (recommended)
#   * 0.95: Slower, more thorough search
#   * 0.7: Faster convergence

# ACOR is particularly effective for:
# - Multimodal problems (many local optima)
# - Problems requiring balance of exploration/exploitation
# - Continuous optimization in complex landscapes
