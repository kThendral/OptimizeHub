# Sample Differential Evolution Configuration for OptimizeHub
# This file demonstrates how to configure Differential Evolution

algorithm: differential_evolution

problem:
  dimensions: 3
  fitness_function: rosenbrock
  lower_bound: -5
  upper_bound: 5
  objective: minimize

params:
  population_size: 50
  max_iterations: 50
  F: 0.8
  CR: 0.9
  strategy: rand/1/bin
  boundary_handling: clip

# Parameter Guide:
# - F (0 < F <= 2): Controls mutation strength. Higher = more exploration
#   * 0.5-0.8: Conservative, good for fine-tuning
#   * 0.8-1.2: Balanced exploration/exploitation
# 
# - CR (0 <= CR <= 1): Crossover rate. Higher = more parameter mixing
#   * 0.9: High diversity (recommended for most problems)
#   * 0.7: Moderate mixing
#   * 0.3: Low mixing (exploitation-focused)
#
# - strategy options:
#   * rand/1/bin: Classic DE, random base vector
#   * best/1/bin: Uses best solution as base (faster convergence)
#   * rand/2/bin: Uses 5 vectors (more robust)
#
# - boundary_handling options:
#   * clip: Force values within bounds (default)
#   * reflect: Bounce back from boundaries
#   * wrap: Wrap around to other side
