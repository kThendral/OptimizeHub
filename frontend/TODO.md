# Styling OptimizeHub App - Academic/Research Dashboard Vibe

## Overview
Apply styling to the app for an academic/research dashboard look: White background, blue/gray colors, small accent colors for charts/data. Use Tailwind CSS for responsive, modern design.

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Update src/App.jsx for overall layout (flexbox centering, background, responsiveness).
- [x] Style src/components/LandingPage.jsx (hero layout, centered text, styled button).
- [x] Style src/components/ProblemSelector.jsx (form card, better select styling).
- [x] Style src/components/ParameterForm.jsx (form card, improved inputs).
- [x] Style src/components/UploadForm.jsx (enhanced file input, selects, button).
- [x] Style src/components/AlgorithmSelector.jsx (card wrapper, styled select/input/button).
- [x] Style src/components/ResultsDisplay.jsx (bordered box, monospace font for JSON).
- [ ] Test the app in browser at http://localhost:5175/ for visual improvements and responsiveness.
- [ ] Adjust based on any issues or further feedback.

## Notes
- Use blue/gray theme (e.g., bg-gray-50, text-blue-600, borders-gray-300).
- Ensure mobile responsiveness with Tailwind responsive classes.
- Add shadows, hover effects for interactivity.
