## ‚úÖ What's Currently Available

### Algorithms (4 Production-Ready)
1. **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** - Bio-inspired, good for continuous problems
2. **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** - Evolutionary approach, versatile for many problem types
3. **Differential Evolution (DE)** - Population-based, excellent for global optimization
4. **Ant Colony Optimization (ACOR)** - Archive-based, effective for multi-modal problems

### Problem Types (7 Total)
**Benchmark Functions (5):**
- Sphere, Rastrigin, Rosenbrock, Ackley, Griewank

**Real-World Problems (2 Fully Integrated):**
- Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) - Find optimal routes
- Knapsack Problem - Maximize value within capacity constraints

### User Interface Features
- Manual form input with tooltips
- YAML file upload for automation
- Interactive visualizations (TSP map, convergence curves)
- Real-time results display
- Preset configurations for quick testing
